Games 1 and 2
<div class="row" style="margin-top: 20px;">

    <h3>Unusual for my style of play</h3>

      Although my usual game is grind out and play closed until my opponent slips up, I really did enjoy taking this attack on.
      To be fair I am playing 500 elo below my peak so...

  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">
    <h3>2.e5 with a beautiful attack!</h3>

         alt="2.e5 attack"
         class="img-responsive center-block">
    <p class="text-muted">
      Similar to the previous game, I ended up opening the position and attacking.
      Not sure what the thought process was behind hanging the rook on a8?? Although I missed the Nxb5 idea,
      cramming his pieces together and mating the black king was very satisfying.
      I think I'll study 2.e5 more!

      This was a close save. The knight and queen combo did pull me back from the brink.
      Not sure why my brain decided to backfire on me, but glad my opponent's brain decided to do the same as well.

    <h3>Averbakh, you beauty!</h3>

    <p class="text-muted">
      I cannot tell you how long I've waited for some nerd who just mugs stuff up to play the open Sicilian against my Averbakh Dragon.
      My heart rate kept increasing until I saw Bh6 on the board! AAAAA!

Games 5 and 6 
<div class="row" style="margin-top: 20px;">

    <h3>Double killer knights</h3>

         alt="Double knights"
         class="img-responsive center-block">
    <p class="text-muted">
      Chopping my opponent's king side with both my knights was satisfying.
      One of the few very nice middle game checkmates I've performed over the board!

         alt="Push the h and g pawns"
         class="img-responsive center-block">
    <p class="text-muted">
      Was Fischer wrong about the Dragon? Although this wasn't the Dragon, listening to his advice of pushing the h and g pawns
      brought me a very easy win!
