        I'm a graduate student at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> diving deeper into ML research! I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology from <a target="blank" href= "https://www.iith.ac.in/">IIT Hyderabad</a> in 2024.

            <li>During my undergrad, I worked with <a target="blank" href= "https://borthakurayon.github.io/">Dr. Ayon Borthkaur</a> to create an algorithm which trains neural networks without the need for backpropagation. I extensively studied <strong>local learning, few shot learning, and few epoch learning</strong>, incorporating the algorithm with all these features.</li>
            <li>I've had the pleasure to work with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/">Prof. Sumohana Channappayya</a> on digital video compression. I came up with a novel <strong>transform inspired by field dynamics</strong> which shows improved performance over the traditional DCT, especially in texture rich regions.</li>
            <li>Since then I've explored tons of graph compression algorithms with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/shashankvatedka/html/home.html">Dr. Shashank Vatedka</a> and more recently, worked on very <strong>high dimensional data compression</strong>, aiming to reduce transmission to less than 1 bit per dimension.</li>
        </ol>

    Presently, I'm working with <a target="blank" href= "https://goldblum.github.io/">Dr. Micah Goldblum</a>, the <a target="blank" href= "https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/">Wilson Lab</a> at NYU (Courant) towards <strong>optimized training of LLMs</strong>.

            <li>During the first few years of my virtual undergrad (caused by the pandemic), I worked at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.anitechsolutions.com/">Anitech Solutions</a> mentored by <a target="blank" href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnolan/?originalSubdomain=ie">CEO Andrew Nolan</a> where I worked with the Engineering team and Business Analysts to deliver and elaborate on functional and non functional requirements of <strong>KnowCost for JIRA</strong>.</li>
            <li>For the summer of 2023, I worked at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle India</a> as an software intern, where I helped build on Redwood dependency analyzer for Redwood Infrastructure Components and Services (RADAR).</li>

        My free time is usually consumed by badminton, football, jogging, and chess. If not these, you can always find me binging TV shows or drowning myself with novels about crime, fiction and fantasy.
        Recently, I'm completely taken by Catan!
