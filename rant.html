    <font size="6">Continual Learning</font> <br>
    Right off the bat, I hate the fact that continual learning involves constant change of the underlying distributions of data. It's as if the problem requires capturing of a time varying data distribution but without having no clue as to what is yet to come.
    Makes it very hard to accommodate for in an elegant fashion. If I was making the human brain, I would resort to something like a "recall" function to remember what was learnt and get used to it before learning a new task.
